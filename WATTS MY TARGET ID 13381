Hey Guys! ﻿I tr﻿y to do Icecrown Achievment for Loremaster Achievment! And i find this quest bugged.
Quest Name: Watts My Target
ID: 13381
The problem: When u need to kill "Infantry" "Ambusher" "Scourge War Machine" the quest works well.  Thats an another theme, when u get hit from gargoyles, and yr "bomber" get fire, yr hp down go down. only accidentally drops from the "Bomber". We tryed to 2 man it in party. All two of us shoot the "gargoyles" tryed to not get hitted. We managed the first half of the quest. OK. We get where we need to kill 10 "Sentry". Every 2 of us spammed the first spell, when u shoot rockets, to "Sentry"-s nothing happened. 0 DMG dealed. Pls reparir this quest. Its really need for my Loremaster!

Ty, Best wishes.﻿
